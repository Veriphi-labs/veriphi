# How to Obtain a Commercial License

1. **Evaluate the Code**  
   You may freely download, run, and evaluate this project under the AGPL v3.0 license.

2. **Decide on Your Use Case**  
   - If your use is internal, research-based, or compatible with AGPL: you’re all set.  
   - If your use is commercial, proprietary, or closed-source: you will need a commercial license.

4. **Agreement**  
   We’ll provide a simple MIT-style commercial license that allows you to
   integrate, modify, and distribute the software without AGPL obligations.

5. **Commercial Use**  
   Once agreed, you may use the software in proprietary products just as if it
   were licensed under MIT.
